<div align="center">This is the repository for the German team Overengineering² (Georg-Büchner-Gymnasium, Seelze), which competed in
the <a href="https://junior.robocup.org/">RoboCup Junior</a> sub-league <a href="https://junior.robocup.org/rcj-rescue-line/">Rescue-Line</a>.</div>

# About the Competition
<p align="center"><i>
  "The land is too dangerous for humans to reach the victims. Your team has been given a difficult task. The robot must be able to carry out a rescue mission in a fully autonomous mode with no human assistance. The robot must be durable and intelligent enough to navigate treacherous terrain with       hills, uneven land, and rubble without getting stuck. When the robot reaches the victims, it has to gently and carefully transport each one to the safe evacuation point where humans can take over the rescue. The robot should exit the evacuation zone after a successful rescue to continue its          mission throughout the disaster scene until it leaves the site. Time and technical skills are essential!"

  As mentioned in the short scenario introduction of the official <a href="https://junior.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/RCJRescueLine2024-final-1.pdf">2024 Rescue-Line rules</a>, the goal of this competition is to develop a fully autonomous robot capable of performing various tasks on a       series of different obstacle courses. In the competitions, the team whose robot completes the course with the fewest mistakes or human interventions wins. The tasks the robots have to complete along the courses include following a black line with gaps, intersections (the placement of green           intersection markers indicates the direction of the path the robot should follow), speed bumps, large obstacles, debris, ramps, and seesaws. In addition, the robot must recognize the silver reflective strip at the entrance to the so-called evacuation zone (130 cm x 90 cm x at least 10 cm), proceed   into it, first pick up two silver balls (alive victims), place them in the green evacuation point (6 cm high), then pick up a black ball (dead victim) and place it in the red evacuation point. The robot should then find the exit of the evacuation zone (marked with a black line), follow the black     line from there, and finally stop at a red line and remain stationary.

<p align="justify">
There are very few restrictions for the robot. In general, the robot only needs to be able to navigate under tiles that form bridges over other tiles (25 cm high) that are supported by pillars at the corners of the tiles (entry/exit width of 25 cm). Besides that, there are only a few part restrictions on components that have been developed solely for a specific competition task (e.g., ready-to-use line-following cameras).

# About the project

In order to accomplish all of the tasks mentioned above, we decided to take a completely camera-based approach using Raspberry Pi. The development of this design stated in March of 2022 and we iterated on it until now (2024).

## Why open source?

We chose to open source our code because we think our code can be a great learning resource for teams wanting to try out
camera based robots or current teams who are looking for resources about camera robots. Furthermore we think it's
important to share knowledge and we encourage you to do the same! Either by uploading videos of your scoring runs on
YouTube, open sourcing your code or as simple as chatting with other teams at competitions. 

# About the team
The team originally was founded in 2017 through 2 former members and began with a Lego Mindstorms NXT robot. The current team (Tim & Marius) switched to a
camera based robot at around March 2022, when Tim joined the robotics club. We iterated on the design until now (2024) and achieved to finish as the 1st Place 
(Individual Team) at the world championship 2024 in Eindhoven. Our progress can be seen in the many YouTube videos we uploaded over the years. More
information about the team can be found in the poster and TDP (documentation).

We will not participate in any more RoboCup Junior competitions as both of us will be university students in 2025.
