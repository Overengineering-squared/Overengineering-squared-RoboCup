# About the team

This is the repository for the German team Overengineering² (Georg-Büchner-Gymnasium, Seelze), which competed in
the [Robocup Junior Rescue Line](https://junior.robocup.org/rcj-rescue-line/) league. The team originally was founded in
2017 through 2 former members and began with a Lego Mindstorms NXT robot. The current team (Tim & Marius) switched to a
camera based robot at around March 2022, when Tim joined the robotics club. We iterated on the design until now (2024) and achieved to finish as the 1st Place 
(Individual Team) at the world championship 2024 in Eindhoven. Our progress can be seen in the many YouTube videos we uploaded over the years. More
information about the team can be found in the poster and TDP (documentation).

We will not participate in any more RoboCup Junior competitions as both of us will be university students in 2025.

# About the project


## Why open source?

We chose to open source our code because we think our code can be a great learning resource for teams wanting to try out
camera based robots or current teams who are looking for resources about camera robots. Furthermore we think it's
important to share knowledge and we encourage you to do the same! Either by uploading videos of your scoring runs on
YouTube, open sourcing your code or as simple as chatting with other teams at competitions.
